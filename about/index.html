<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>I am pursuing a PhD in philosophy at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>.  I am currently in my fourth year of the program.  My research interests include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Logic, and the Philosophy of Language, Science, Mind, and Religion.  I received my BA in philosophy from the University of Nebraska-Omaha.  <br><br>I also enjoy powerlifting.  Though I have never competed at a powerlifting meet, I do hope to have a 1200 pound total by the end of 2016.  Additionally, I love anything computer related and offer a small repair service here in Lincoln.  I love the opensource community which is why this site is hosted on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.</a></p>
